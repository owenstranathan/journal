I just realized that the problem I've been having setting the value of a python object is because the object actually only wraps another _meta_object, so I keep forgetting that I have to set the value to the sub object. Maybe wrapper objects are kust a bad idea?

2017-12-04 16:23 @TODO make pypi package for kupy

2017-12-04 16:29 @todo finish kupy cli

2017-12-04 16:32 @kupy_notes: I think that gipy can be extracted as a stand alone pygit2 api which can be used elsewhere.
Kupy isnt practically useful outside the current project because of its dependance on tmply, which is useful only if you are willing to make a special repo for your kubernetes files and are also willing to use tmply sketches which are cool

2017-12-04 16:33 @idea: Use gipy to pull down hosted journal and have a page on website that posts all entries.
Maybe the site can use jrnl to get entries willy nilly

2017-12-04 17:11 @todo finish implementing kupy api

2017-12-05 15:06 today at 1pm I presented kupy in its current state to @alexquick.
He liked it and gave me some suggestions. Then we did our one on one meeting and he oulined the 3 month plan

2017-12-05 17:28 @TIL that you can make in-class decorators by having the inner function in the decorator accept a self, the syntactic magic python does makes this unclear

2017-12-05 17:29 @todo Make kupy better and forceably inject it into opsbot

2017-12-05 22:40 @todo figure out how to get the last pinned deployment and associate it with new deployments write function opsbot.opsbot.models.core.Deployment.last_one_like_me

I figured out how to use incluster config and authentication with python kubernetes

``` python
    from kubernetes import client, config

    config.load_incluster_config()
    v1_core = client.CoreV1Api()
```

This will be useful once bender is running on a kubernetes pod

2017-12-28 22:29 @todo make indiviual containers with good entry points for worker and web.

2018-03-01 17:31 @PEP8 You can force flake to ignore a line with an inline comment and with pyilnt

2018-03-01 17:33 @PEP8 You can force flake to ignore a line with an inline comment

2018-03-01 17:37 @PEP8

Putting "noqa" in an inline comment forced flake to ignore errors on that line
similarly putting "pylint: diable=THING" will cause pylint to ignore aswell

Ex:

``` python
import logging # noqa # pylint: disable=unused-import
```
