I just realized that the problem I've been having setting the value of a python object is because the object actually only wraps another _meta_object, so I keep forgetting that I have to set the value to the sub object. Maybe wrapper objects are kust a bad idea?

2017-12-04 16:29 @todo finish kupy cli

2017-12-04 16:32 @kupy_notes: I think that gipy can be extracted as a stand alone pygit2 api which can be used elsewhere.
Kupy isnt practically useful outside the current project because of its dependance on tmply, which is useful only if you are willing to make a special repo for your kubernetes files and are also willing to use tmply sketches which are cool

2017-12-04 16:33 @idea: Use gipy to pull down hosted journal and have a page on website that posts all entries.
Maybe the site can use jrnl to get entries willy nilly
